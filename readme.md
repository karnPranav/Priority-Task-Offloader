# Priority Task Offloading with Dijkstra’s Algorithm

## Overview
This project simulates **priority-based task offloading** for autonomous and connected vehicles using **Python**.  
It applies **Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm** along with reinforcement learning concepts to optimize task scheduling and reduce computation latency in edge computing environments.

## Directory Structure
- `main.py`: Entry point for the simulation.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists dependencies.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it.
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the simulation: `python main.py`

## Results and Graphs
The simulation produces performance graphs such as:
- Task completion time vs. number of tasks
- Offloading success rate vs. task priority
- Comparison of Dijkstra-based scheduling with baseline approaches

*(Graphs can be added to a `results/` folder and referenced here.)*
